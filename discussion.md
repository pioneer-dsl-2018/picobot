#  How much time did you spend on this assignment?

I spent a total of approximately 6 hours working on this assignment. I committed a total of 2 hours to familiarizing myself with Picobot, forking the files for the assignment, running a few test programs using the library, and writing the "library" version of the empty-room program for Picobot. Post this, I spent an estimated 1.5 hours comprehending and testing the Scala syntax for case classes and lists before spending another 1.5 hours on part 4 of the assignment to add fluency to the library. Here, I spent a massive proportion of that time working on the logic rather than the code itself. Understanding the concept of implicit classes and functions and then using these concepts to try to remove some degree of the "host flavour" took me another hour.

Below, add one or two things that you might want to discuss when we meet again.

In order to try to add efficiency to Picobot, I would really like to understand how we could edit the library so that it can keep track of spots it has already visited. I would also like to talk a little more about implicit classes and functions and the different scenarios in which we would use them.
